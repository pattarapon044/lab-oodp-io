Lab - Input Output
==========

Before you start
----------
The purpose of this lab is to practice reading and writing object to file. Various classes in java.io will be used to accomplish the exercises. Please read the instruction below.s


Exercise One - Read characters
-------------
Complete the ​ printNumEsWithFileReader() method in the ​ lab.oodp.io.numchar.CharCounter class,
which should use a ​ FileReader to read input2.txt and print out the following
information:
1. The total number of characters in the file
2. The number of e’s and E’s in the file

Please use TestCharCounter to test your code.

Exercise Two - Movie Read and Write
-------------
In the lab.oodp.io.movie package you’ll see the Movie class from a previous lab. In this exercise, we’ll create two programs: *MovieWriter* will create a file containing data for lots of movies, while *MovieReader* one will read that file and create Movie objects.

1. Complete MovieWriter’s *saveMovies* method. This method should use a DataOutputStream to write the contents of the films array to the given file. ​ 

2. Complete MovieReader’s *loadMovies* method. This method should use a
DataInputStream to read the contents of the given file and use it to create, fill and
return an array of Movie objects.

**Note: You should not make any assumptions about the number of movies in the array – your program (and the one in part 2) should work for any number of movies!** 

Below is expected output when running MovieReader.
